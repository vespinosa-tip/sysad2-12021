Role Name
==========================

Here is the brief description of role.

Requirements
--------------------------

Any pre-requisites that may not be covered by ansible itself or the roles should be mentioned here. For instance, if the role uses the EC2 module, it may be a good idea to mention in this section that the boto package is required.

Role Variables
--------------------------

A description of the settablle variables for this role should go here, including variables that are in defaults/main.yml, vars/main.yml, and any variables that can/should be set via parameters to the role. Any variables that are read from other roles and/or the global scope (ie. hostvars, groupvars, etc.) should be mentioned as well.

Dependencies
--------------------------

A list of other roles hosted on Galaxy should go here, plus any details in regards to parameters that may need to be set for other roles, or variables that are used frm other roles.

Examples Playbook
--------------------------

Including an axample of how to use your role (for instance with variables passed in as parameters) is always nice for users too:

	- hosts: servers
	  roles:
	    -{ role: username.rolename, x: 42}
